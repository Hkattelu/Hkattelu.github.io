We’re in an upgrade cycle. New models, new specs, new primitives every quarter. In this environment, **speed is table stakes** — but speed without safety is just churn.

Here’s the pattern that worked repeatedly.

## 1) Prototype in days, not weeks

- Use the smallest workable scope: a single path, a single data source, a single user action.
- Build the “ugly vertical”: logging, toggles, metrics from day one so the prototype is demo‑able and measurable.
- Keep the code disposable. You’re testing a behavior, not writing a framework.

Outcome: product can react to a real thing, not a deck.

## 2) Evaluate like a product

- Define success criteria you can measure this week: CTR, dwell time, task completion, quality rubrics.
- Run side‑by‑side with a baseline; capture deltas on real‑ish traffic.
- Keep a curated eval set of 100–200 examples that reflect the problem slice.

Outcome: decisions are evidence‑based and legible to non‑engineers.

## 3) Add guardrails as soon as it’s interesting

- Refusals for sensitive content; rate limits and timeouts; circuit breakers for dependencies.
- Caching: product cache (repeat answers) + outage cache (stale‑acceptable answers).
- Rollout plan with a crisp kill switch.

Outcome: you’re fast **and** trustworthy.

## 4) Productionize the parts that survive

- Separate the prompt/policy layer from the application logic and UI style.
- Turn one‑off scripts into versioned components with changelogs.
- Invest in clear oncall docs: alerts, playbooks, owners.

Outcome: iteration gets faster over time instead of slower.

## 5) Culture: celebrate boring wins

Boring engineering is how you go fast on purpose. Launches that don’t wake anyone up at 3am are a competitive advantage.

### A checklist I keep around

- [ ] Scope is one flow, one persona
- [ ] Metrics + logs from day one
- [ ] Eval set + baseline comparison
- [ ] Guardrails: refusals, limits, cache, kill switch
- [ ] Rollout plan in the PR description
- [ ] Ownership, runbook, and post‑launch bake time

The tech will change. The feedback loop is the product.

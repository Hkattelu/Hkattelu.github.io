Hi! I’m Himanshu — a senior engineer in NYC focused on AI‑first product experiences. I ship end‑to‑end: fast, delightful UI; serving hooks; telemetry; and the quality loops that make features safe and reliable.

Currently I am working on improving the core Youtube user experience with thoughtful AI integration.

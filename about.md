<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University. If you had to 
know one thing about me, it's that I don't leave things half-done. I pride myself in taking a system and 
figuring out every single detail of it. I put in the <strong>time</strong> and <strong>effort</strong> needed to produce quality work that I am 
proud of. I challenge myself to not believe things blindly without understanding.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">And I love it all every step of the way.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">My primary interests are in algorithms, software development, and data science. When I'm not programming, I'm 
hanging out with my friends, browsing Quora and Wikipedia, or listening to music. You can check out what I've
worked on my github (bottom of page).

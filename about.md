<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
I graduated from SUNY Stony Brook University with a B.S in Computer Science and 
Applied Mathematics. I currently work at Google in google cloud logging.
I have a lot of experience in Front-end web development and project design.
If you had to know one thing about me, it's that I genuinely like learning
about and building new things (even if they <i>sometimes</i> break along the way
). I pride myself in taking a system and figuring out every single detail of it.
I put in the <strong>time</strong> and <strong>effort</strong> needed to 
produce quality work that I am proud of. I challenge myself to not believe 
things blindly without understanding.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">And I like doing it every step of the way.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">
My primary interests are in scalability, databases, asynchronous systems,
machine learning, and cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, I also do things besides
program. I'm usually hanging out with my friends, listening to music,
attempting to work out, travelling, or juggling (sometimes all at once). 
I am also known to occasionally read books and write blog posts.
You can check out what I've worked on my github (bottom of page) or explore
the rest of my blog.

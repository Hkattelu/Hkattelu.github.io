          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/programming/2018/07/08/Programming-Environments-my-vim-setup.html">How important is coding fast?</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>Every once in a while I find myself in a conversation with a friend about
typing. Sometimes they talk about their typing speeds, sometimes about the
text editors they use, and sometimes even the keyboards they use. As
someone who has to type code for a living, I decided to see what I could
do to optimize my programming before I start my new job. I already knew
that increasing my actually typing speed with practice wasn’t going to
help too much. The best thing to do was to learn a new text editor with a
lot of shortcuts and tricks to make things easier. I wasn’t going to bother
buying a fancy new keyboard because that would cost too much time to learn,
and possibly a lot of money. Then I started to think - what is typing
<em>really</em> and what’s the best thing I can do.</p>

<h2>Logging machines</h2>

<p>Typing is, first and foremost, just a method of logging down your thoughts.
Handwriting and typing have the same purpose, but typing just makes your
thoughts easier to spread and process because it produces digital logs. 
What we’re interested in isn’t necessarily typing fast - we care more about
logging fast. To generalize, think of editors as just a type of logging
machine - a tool that takes inputs (keystrokes) and outputs logs.</p>

<p>Logging machines don’t have to be editors like Microsoft word, Emacs,
or notepad. A pen and paper are a logging machines with handstrokes as
inputs. A camera is a logging machine with a visible light input.
Even the copy/paste tool is a logging machine that takes highlightable 
text as input. It happens to be that some machines are better
than others at logging down certain thoughts - it would take me a very
long time to log the contents of a 300-page book to another book with
notepad, but I could do it really fast with a printing press. A nice
thing about logging machines is that you can build one thats tailored
to the thoughts you want to log. It (mostly) does not matter what the
thought is.</p>

<p>It follows that in theory, a machine can only ever log as fast as you 
can think. Keeping that bottleneck in mind, the theoretical optimal editor
doesn’t just let you type inputs as fast as you can think - it also 
interrupts your thinking the least. Additionally, the optimal editor should
not take any time to learn and should be completely intuitive. Basically,
we want to come as close as possible to a machine that literally hooks up
to your brain and puts your thoughts down. While that’s probably never
going to happen, it is interesting to think about all of the properties
of logging machines to better compare them.</p>

<h2>Things to consider</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Input Complexity - An editor with a lot of inputs is going to not just
require a lot of learning time, but it might also interrupt your thinking
while typing. For example, notepad has few inputs - just the letters on
the keyboard plus a little more. Vim on the otherhand uses a lot of keys
you wouldn’t normally use like ESC and CTRL, and basically has a different
function for every combination of keystrokes imaginable. We would like 
to minimize the number of inputs as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Input tools - It should be easy to input into a logging machine. It
takes a lot of time to use a mouse (think of the last time you used a 
visual keyboard on your PC), so we want to minimize the time we spend
switching between mouse and keyboard.</li>
  <li>Generality - If i’m writing a document, my editor needs to be versatile
enough to handle and maybe input images. The ability to handle images
will require additional input complexity, but it will greatly add to 
logging power.</li>
  <li>Similarity to known machines - It’s generally a lot easier to learn
an editor that is similar something you already know. For example, you
should be able to pick up Google docs pretty fast if you already know
Microsoft word.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My final choice(s): Vim and Sublime</h2>

<p>I think that because different editors are better at doing different
things, its natural that I select two different editors for the two
different kinds of programming I do.</p>

<p>For java, python, and scala programming I use vim.
Despite the fact that it’s complex, it allows you do things all on
the keyboard. No more clicking around to navigate and open files.
Vim is also great because it’s customizable, so I can easily add
shortcuts from other editors that I like - such as the ability to
move lines up and down. Also, vim runs in a terminal which is very
convenient for any sort of writing on a mac or linux. For anyone
interested, by .vimrc is here..</p>

<p>For HTML, CSS, and Javascript I like to use sublime. The convenient
thing about sublime is that my mouse is already going to be moving
around because I’m testing out website front ends, so I don’t feel
slowed down by using it, and I get the benefits of it like easy
copy/pasting. Sublime also has a great plugin for HTML writing 
called emmet which allows me to create tabs insanely fast without
ever having to type a ‘&lt;’,’&gt;’, or ‘/’.</p>

<p>I highly recommend both vim and sublime for productivity. Even though
I probably wasted more time researching and learning editors than
I will save, I recommend everyone to go out and try to learn something
new. You might find something new you like.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/books/2018/06/20/Books-I-read-in-the-last-year.html">Books I read in the last year</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>In the last year I actually ended up reading a few books (no, I don’t
know how I did it either). Here I’m going to list out some important
take away points from each book and what I think about the book overall.
All of the books I read were non-fiction and somehow statistics related
so they actually did have “lessons” in them. Here they go in order:</p>

<h3>The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver</h3>

<p>This book has a good premise. Whenever humans try to make predictions or
forecasts (they are different) they have to base them on some information.
The difficult part of this information is that a lot of it is “noise” that
doesn’t matter or just confuses us. What we need to look for is the “signal”.</p>

<p>The author makes a lot of cool case studies, such as how we have no idea how to
accurately predict earthquakes but people try to (mistaking noise for signals).
It also brings up the financial crisis and how many companies including the
ratings agencies like moody’s saw it coming but chose to ignore it (ignoring
the signal). It also brings up a cool story about how world champion Garry
Kasparov lost in chess to IBM’s Deep Blue AI. He then talks about statistics
for a while.</p>

<p>The author’s writing is good too but my problem with the book is that it
doesn’t make clear how to tell signals apart from noise. In fact, all of
the case studies make the comparison in hindsight. For me its a 3/5. I 
recommend it only if you are interested in this sort of stuff abd don’t know
too much about it already.</p>

<h3>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens
Democracy - Cathy O Neil</h3>

<p>You would never think that big data and machine learning could actually have
a negative impact on parts of society. That’s the big idea that this book
explores. The case studies that are presented in this book are extremely eye
opening and they highlight the problems of AI and machine learning in our
society.</p>

<p>If an algorithm is based purely on a lot of data and math, it is probably
right is one of the core ideas. The author notes that while machines help
our society operate more efficiently, the businessmen that use the machines
usually have absolutely no idea when they work. When people come to them to
question the algorithm, they can’t change anything about the algorithms and
the easy reply is to trust the algorithm. It can lead to a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>One eye opening case study the author points out is how targeted ads are used
to pitch ads for for-profit colleges to poor neighborhoods. These colleges
are about business and the degrees have been shown to be not worth much at all.
Yet the targeted ads keep students going to them, and keeps the people in
those neighborhoods in a vicious cycle of poverty. Another case study was with a
crime prediction software used by the NYPD. Engineers fed decades of crime data
into the machine learning algorithm to make it predict where the next crimes
would most likely occur. It turns out this software keeps police patrolling the
same low-income neighborhoods mentioned earlier. Moreoever since they patrol
those neighborhoods more, they get more crimes there and the machine keeps
telling them to go there. The worst part is no one can question a machine.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this one especially if you interested in ethics and
big data. The writing was decent, the thing about this book that will keep
you reading is the case studies. I give it a 3.5/5</p>

<h3>What the Luck? The Surprising Role of Chance in Our Everyday Lives - 
Gary Smith</h3>

<p>Despite being the book that taught me the least among the rest, I actually
liked this one the most. The writing is very good and the way the author
explains stuff makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The big thing that the author talks about here is called “Regression to the
mean” and he gives a lot of cool examples. My favorite one is this:
Smart women tend to date guys who are not as smart as them. It turns out
that that is a fact. Now it’s easy to say that women like to feel 
intellectually superior or that guys are just not as smart in general but
the author makes a key point. If you are a smart person, you are simply less
likely to meet someone as smart as you. Everything in the book is based on this.
He also talks about some other interesting things like standardized test
grading and air force pilot training, but you can check it out yourself.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend this book, its worth a read if you want to learn more
about how randomness plays a role in your everyday life. I give it a 4/5.</p>

<h3>The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable - Nassim Taleb</h3>

<p>This book probably had the most knowledge packed into it, but it also had
some of the most pretentious and hard to understand writing in it as well.</p>

<p>There is too much in this book to unpack but I’ll explain the title. It turns
out that back in the day during the age of exploration people believed that
all swans were white. They thought so cause they only ever saw white swans.
Until the one day that they did see a black swan and it challenged everything
they thought they know. This book is about those “black swan” events that
no one sees coming. The author characterizes them, describes when they show up,
and what kind of impact they could have.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a good read don’t bother with this. If really you want to 
gain some knowledge about how uncertainty takes form and shapes events in 
the world, check this book out. I give it a 3.5/5.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/other/2018/05/10/The-most-useful-git-tips-and-tricks.html">My most useful git tips and tricks</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>Most people see git as a nuisance when they first learn about it in school.
There are a lot of commands to learn. Fetch, clone, push, commit, add, reset,
stash, and so on. What I did when I first started is just learned the bare
minimum of the commands I needed to know. Clone to download the repo,
add to add changes, commit to persist changes, and push to push changes to
the repository on github. It became a cycle -</p>

<p>(1) git add .</p>

<p>(2) git commit -m “Brief commit message”</p>

<p>and occasionally,</p>

<p>(3) git pull</p>

<p>After all, for most projects (especially solo ones) that’s all you need.
The truth is each one of these has caused me a lot of problems before.
In this post i’m going to outline the problem and then put a better solution
to use for each one. Trust me, it’ll save you a lot of time and headache
if you follow this post.</p>

<h3>git add .</h3>

<p>The problem with this command is that it adds every change to your list of
staged changes. Isn’t that what you always want anyway? Not always. When it
comes to group work this single command can waste hours of time if one person
accidentally pushes a set of cached files or IDE settings. For example, if
I push my eclipse settings which link to JRE8 and my coworker who pulls it
has JRE9, it will break their program. It’ll also take a while for them to find
the error because the commit message will say something like “Added this 
feature to this module”, but it’s neither the module nor the feature that
caused him the error in reality. The only giveaway that it’s a setting will
be that the code works on your computer but not theirs.</p>

<p>How can we get around this? You might think to just add the settings folders
to your .gitignore but even then you might stage accidental changes. The only
good way to do this is to take your time to manually add the files you want
to add. <em>git status</em> will tell you a list of unstaged changes and you can
just go through them and add them individually. This may seem like a lot of
work, but if you are commiting in proper increments you should only be adding
a few files at once.</p>

<h3>git commit -m </h3>

<p>This one seems like a really good command at first. You get to input a 
brief but descriptive commit message, commit all the changes you staged, and
do it easily in one command. The problem is that the commit message that
git automatically generates for you is probably better. It includes all
the files that were changed (for debugging) and all you have to do is get
rid of the ‘#’s to uncomment them</p>

<p>You can combine this one with the add in the last one using a command
thats in the more updated versions of git called <em>git commit -p</em>. This great
command actually automatically loops through every file change and asks if
you want to add and commit it or not. If you master it and the shortcut,
you can add and commit every file change in seconds, and without making the
mistakes I mentioned earlier.</p>

<h3>git pull</h3>

<p>The problem with git pull when you work in a team is that it usually will
try to do a merge and then force you to resolve conflicts yourself. 99% of the
time what you really would like it to do is pull their changes and then 
put your changes on top of them (usually will avoid merge conflicts) and
is what you want. You can accomplish this by using git fetch to pull the changes
on the remote branches. Then, you can git rebase to move your changes on top
of their branch, avoid marge problems and keeping your tree clean of MERGE
commit messages. This will also make is so you don’t accidentally resolve
the merge conflicts incorrectly and introduce more problems.</p>

<p>There you have it. A few new git commands that will help you improve your
productivity in development. If you thought any of this was helpful, or if
you know any better commands, please feel free to shoot me an e-mail or message.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/other/2017/01/05/How-to-learn-coding-without-losing-motivation.html">How to learn coding without losing motivation</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>Sometimes my friends ask me, “How long would it take for me to learn python?” or “Where do I start coding
to get a job?”. I tell them that if they pick a language and stick to it, then maybe work on a project or two,
they will be well on their way to being a capable programmer. Then, they might ask me some follow-ups like
“How exactly do I start? What should I download? Where are tutorials?” and I will point them in the right direction.
I then go about my life as usual and then check on them a week later. What happens?</p>

<p>They’ve given up! I’m so confused! How could it be that my friend was so excited to learn about programming but quit so
quickly? The process of obtaining the software wasn’t hard (These days, sites like codecademy let you type code on the web),
the beginner code couldn’t have been too hard either, so what went wrong? I ask them what went wrong and usually it’s
something along the lines of “I didn’t have enough motivation” or “I just stopped after a day”. I stop and think about
it for a while.</p>

<p><img src="http://nec1908.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11051772_10153177278493893_8339865091411561609_n.jpg" alt="Motivate" height="300px" width="300px" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>Sure, it makes sense. My friends wanted to learn, but after a shoft while lost motivation even after they started. But
this brings up an interesting question. How is it possible for you to learn how to code on your own if you keep losing 
motivation? The reality is that there is no way to magically keep a steady supply of motivation for you to learn, so
what can we do? You hear stories about 16-year old geniuses starting companies with code they wrote from when they were
accepted to MIT at 13 because they learned at age 9. But where do those people start?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we first need to look at some of the other underlying reasons why it’s hard to code without
motivation.</p>

<h3> It isn't fun </h3>

<p><img src="http://www.richstoner.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/shutterstock_52649824-e1418935346529.jpg" alt="Basketball" height="300px" width="300px" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>Compare coding to a hobby such as basketball. How come there are people so excited to go out to the courts to play and learn to
play ball or watch it on TV? The obvious difference is that basketball is (for many people) actually a lot of fun even if you
are just learning. You can still play with other people who are just starting out, and you will have a good time. When you code,
it’s typically alone in front of an IDE or some tutorial. When you remove that fun aspect, your incentive to learn drops 
<em>dramatically</em>. This is no surprise, but what can we do about it? Well some sites like CodeFights have tried to fix this by
turning coding into a game, but generally this won’t work. One possible way to fix this is to get a group of friends to learn
with you. The addition of other people could add a competitive element to your learning which might make it more enjoyable.
However, don’t let another person’s success demotivate you. This leads me to my next point.</p>

<h3> Failure is unavoidable </h3>

<p>I understood programming very quickly and was able to get my first project full up and running in less than an hour thanks
to the tutorial - said no one ever. One thing that all beginners <em>have</em> to understand is that there is literally <em>no</em> <em>one</em>
who thinks programming a project is easy. Ask any professional with years of experience and they will tell you just how much
they struggled. I myself took 2 hours just to get my first “Hello World” program up and running because the tutorial didn’t tell
me how to fix the compiler errors. When I was making this blog none of the posts would show up because the dates were in the 
future. When I made my first website I didn’t realize you had to link your css file in your html header and wondered why nothing
was working. And all of this is not even the tip of the iceberg. If you are in a group of programmers and they talk about 
some complicated project they are working on, you cannot let this demotivate you a single bit. Instead, think about how much
they failed to get to where they are, and realize that you can do it too no matter how many road blocks you face in the moment.</p>

<h3> Lack of (Immediate) reward </h3>

<p><img src="http://cdn.webfail.com/upl/img/f8454067544/post2.jpg" alt="Snowmen" height="300px" width="300px" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>There is a pretty big gap in what a programmer does when he is a professional, and what he does when he is a beginner. Many 
beginners have to realize that the process of learning cannot happen over a week, a month, or even a year. You might want to 
get your big automated mobile app website function compiler running as soon as possible, but you can’t do it without learning
what a for loop is. Typically, once you learn how to print “Hello World”, you are not impressed. In basketball it is fun to make
your first shot slam against the backboard and whoosh into the net. In programming, you are greeted with text on a screen. If 
you are fast, you might be greeted with an image on the screen in a few days. The point is, you aren’t really immediately 
rewarded for your coding efforts, and your brain sees that and decides to become demotivated. After all, why would you do 
something if there is no positive reinforcement in it for you? An easy solution to this is to simply reward yourself everytime
you hit a milestone. When you learn the basics of a language go out for dinner, when you understand how pointers work go ice
skating, when you make your first website go get a massage. It’s a simple idea that can go a long way in keeping you focused.</p>

<h3> Start a project </h3>

<p><img src="http://betamore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Learn-to-Code.png" alt="Website" height="300px" width="300px" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>A beginner might be tempted to do another tutorial after they finished the first one if they do not feel like they learned 
enough. To this I say, no. As soon as you finish your tutorials on a subject, I say you should jump right into a project. The 
main reason is that once you’ve started on something, you will typically feel uneasy if you let it go unfinished. As a result, 
you have a much bigger incentive to return to coding once you’ve lost your motivation. This will also teach you good future 
habits such as googling/using stack overflow if you don’t know how to solve a problem. In the end, you will eventually finish
you project and give you something to be proud of.</p>

<h3> Keep a portfolio </h3>

<p>It’s a good idea to keep a portfolio of all projects you’ve ever completed because it becomes a great go-to source of 
motivation. To this day I feel an urge to program every time I look at my github repositories. It lets me look back at my
work and say “Wow, I remember when I solved X with Y. I should’ve used Z instead”. It also gives you a more tangible 
reward for all of the work you put into learning.</p>

<h3> Spend time with other programmers </h3>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uSnS-YBGEtY/TKRVSv7z7HI/AAAAAAAAAUs/Vkf31yzPejs/s1600/s7.jpg" alt="People" height="300px" width="300px" text-align="center" /></p>

<p>If you want to learn programming, surround yourself with it. In fact, it is crucial in learning anything to surround yourself
with people who are way better than you. When you’re surrounded with programmers and you really want to learn, you will see
it for yourself. You will observe the way they solve problems, the way they stick to their work through hardship, the way
they read documentation, and even the way they carry themselves in their daily life. When surrounded by people smarter than
you, you can only get better. To this day I still look around me and see people who are better, and it makes me want to strive
to become the best programmer I can be. It’s hard at times being the worst at something in the room, but find happiness in
the fact that there is no where to go but up if you do this.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, you can have all the motivation in the world and still not be able to learn to code. At times like this
its important to check with yourself: Why do I really want to learn to code? Do I even want to learn that badly? Because you
will never be able to learn to do something if you don’t genuinely want to do it.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/other/2016/09/03/Transfer-Protocols.html">Transfer Protocols</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>In a world where the internet is becoming an increasingly 
integral part of our lives, the need for secure information 
transfer is greater than ever. On the web, information is 
transferred mainly through two protocols – HTTP (HyperText 
Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Secure). You have 
definitely seen both of these in your browser URL box, but 
what do they actually mean and how do they work? To answer 
those questions, we have to go into detail.</p>

<h4>Transfer Protocols</h4>

<p>The concept of a transfer protocol is simple. How can the 
client and server transfer information securely. By secure,
I mean that transfer must ideally:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not be able to be intercepted</li>
  <li>Only be understood by the proper parties</li>
  <li>Not require prior contact between the parties</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see secure transfers outside of the internet in 
many places. For example, the US postal service mails items
in trucks so that other people can’t just steal your mail. 
Additionally, the only thing that the mailer’s must know 
about eachother is their addresses. They don’t have to 
agree on a envelope size, color, or even the postal service 
to use.</p>

<p>This isn’t anything new, Julius Caesar also used to send out 
letters to his allies. However, they didn’t have armored 
trucks back then, so he settled for a very primitive form of 
encryption known today as the Caesar cipher. Basically, he 
would “encrypt” his messages by shifting the letters of the 
alphabet a certain number of times. This way, even if an 
attacker intercepted the letter,they wouldn’t be able to 
decrypt it and understand it. Sounds good right? Almost. The 
only problem with this is that Caesar would have to 
communicate the number of times to shift the alphabet to his 
allies <strong>before</strong> the letter is sent out. It sucks for 
Caesar, but this isn’t a problem in the modern day. HTTP and 
HTTPS are vastly more advanced, but at the core they follow 
the exact same concepts.</p>

<h4>HTTP</h4>

<p>HTTP is a protocol that specifies the format of the HTTP
request, which allows for information to be sent between client
and server. HTTP requests are typically sent over port 80, but
can be done over any port.</p>

<p>The format is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“HTTP://”</li>
  <li>The url of the host domain (EX: www.hkattelu.github.io)</li>
  <li>The path to the resource (EX: /blog)</li>
  <li>Query string to search (EX: ?date=9.02.16)</li>
</ol>

<p>This tells the server to return the resource at the path /blog
that fulfills the query string’s requirement. If there is no
resource or query string, the server will typically return
the index.html file to client. The query string can also specify
a POST or DELETE request which is meant to edit the resources of
the server.</p>

<p>HTTP provides a solid interface for fast client-server interaction, but
there is a problem. It is entirely possible for a middle man to
intercept the requests and edit them for their own purposes. This can
lead to bad things if the request contained sensitive information
such as passwords, credit card information, or even a social security
number. The attacker could also edit the request to attack the information
of the server with a POST or DELETE request.</p>

<h4>HTTPS</h4>

<p>HTTPS is almost identical to HTTP from the user’s perspective, but
there is much more going on that is abstracted from the user. There
are only three perceived differences are that the URL contains an “HTTPS”
instead of “HTTP”, that the request usually takes longer to process, and
that the HTTPS URLS use port 443 instead of port 80 by default.
Under the hood, HTTPS is a very secure transfer that makes it nearly
impossible for an attacker to target a connection. The process is as 
follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client and server agree on an encryption algorithm and SSL (Secure Socket Layer) version</li>
  <li>The server sends a certificate to a trusted 3rd party to identify itself and obtain a certificate public key</li>
  <li>The client uses its public key to encrypt the message and sends it to the server</li>
  <li>The server uses its private key to decrypt the message and understand it</li>
  <li>Both client and server now know eachothers keys and can send further messages securely</li>
</ol>

<p>This is somewhat oversimplified, so I’ll explain more.</p>

<p>In the first step, the SSL is an interface that allow for encrypted communications through sockets. It is
the link that messages will go through.</p>

<p>The second step is essentially a verification step. The server must send a certificate to a 3rd party
to verify that it is legit. The certificate will usually include the details of the website like domain name,
and the business registry info. It also includes a digital signature which truly verifies it. For example,
you can claim to be chase bank to steal credit card information, but you cannot verify yourself without the
digital signature. After the verification, the public key is obtained</p>

<p>In the following steps, there is an exchange of “keys”. Basically, a public key is the key that you share with others
and you use it to encrypt data. The private key is the one you keep to yourself to decrypt incoming messages.
The benefit of this two key system is that even if a middle man intercepts your messages, he
cannot decrypt them or make any sense of them without the private key (which is never shared). This 
allows for a secure communication between only the client and server.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that although this HTTPS is vastly more secure, it comes at the cost of time. In most
cases the time for the transactions to occur is negligible, but it is still worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Those are the basics of internet transfer protocols. I hoped this post helped you learn something new
or clarify any existing problems.</p>

        </h2>

	      <p>When you’ve lived in queens for years and went to high school in manhattan you eventually
run out of things to do, even in the big apple. Sure, new stores open and new trendy hangout
spots pop up, but for the most part it’s the same thing. It’s not a bad thing, but I always
end up asking myself if it’s worth it anymore to visit Vanessa’s in chinatown or Gong Cha
in midtown. Despite this, there are a few spots in NYC that I never get tired of visiting.
They’re almost always fun or beautiful, no matter how many times I go. Here they are (in 
no particular order):</p>

<h4>Washington Square Park</h4>

<p>I come here often to visit friends at NYU or just to hang out with the NYU circus arts club.
Even in the winter this place is always bustling with people. The fountain, the arch, the statues,
and even the “pigeon man” all make this spot memorable. There’s always something going on whether it
be yoga in the grass, musicians playing on their instruments, or the chess players in the corners.
On top of being a beautiful spot overall, it’s also close by other notable spots like the Uncommons
(board game cafe).</p>

<h4>Battery park</h4>

<p>The best part about battery park is that it’s by the hudson river. I used to come here after school
to play frisbee with friends. Despite being on this list, it really is just a park. Most of the people
here are either kids who just got out of school or parent’s taking their kids out on walks. The typical
scenery consists of boats sailing across the river, people lying down to tan themselves, and guys
playing handball and basketball. I don’t make it sound like much, but my writing can’t do the 
beauty of this place justice. On top of it all, this place is riddled with statues, has a movie theater 
nearby, lots of places to eat, and there’s a free kayaking spot at Pier 26 nearby.</p>

<h4>Central Park</h4>

<p>Arguably the most famous place on this list, Central park’s beauty comes from its sheer size. I’ve
been here about ten times, but still don’t think I’ve even come close to seeing all that it has to offer.
To put it plainly, every visit to central park is a completely new experience. The only downside I can
think of is that it can take a long time to get out of here, so make sure you bring food and water.</p>

<h4>The Highline</h4>

<p>The Highline is an old and defunct train track turned into a park above the streets. In theory, you could see 
everything it has to offer in one straight walk. But the truth is that it’s such an active place that no
two visits are really the same. There are many events for all ages held here, and tons of nearby restaurants
in bustling downtown manhattan. But the true beauty of the highline doesn’t come from the place itself – but
rather its surroundings. Walking the highline gives you a novel perspective of the city and its buildings
unlike anything else. The buildings, billboards, and graffiti are what truly make this place shine.</p>

<h4>Roosevelt Island</h4>

<p>Roosevelt island, put simply, is one of the nicest places in the city. Compared to the other places on this 
list, it has almost nothing. It is simply a small island with a lot of parks. There are a few sites to see like the 
gondola to manhattan and the stone engravings at the end of island. For the most part though, it is just a
really nice place surrounded by water. In a city where vehicle noise is almost everywhere, the serene sounds of the 
water beating against the rocks makes this one of my favorite places to be.</p>

<p>Those are my top 5 spots in NYC. If I had to give any honorable mentions, they would 
go to Governor’s Island (great place to bike, but it’s only open in the summer), and 
Brooklyn Bridge (nighttime walks on the bridge are arguably the most beautiful thing
in the city, and that’s not even mentioning the DUMBO area). The next time you want
to hang out with some friends and need a place to go, look no further. If you’re just 
a visitor in the city, make sure to check all of these places out. You won’t be 
disappointed.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/other/2016/07/21/Should-you-go-to-a-hackathon.html">Should you go to a hackathon?</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>About twice a semester I’ll go to a hackathon as a break from school to
visit a new place, make some new friends, and see some familiar faces. What?
Aren’t hackathons for making projects? Aren’t you going to be busy
coding non-stop for 24 hours? Don’t you want to win a prize or
build the next big app? The answer is a resounding no.</p>

<p>I’ve heard of a few myths about hackathons from friends and around the internet
in the past couple of months, and a couple of them, in my opinion, are true. The
majority of them are not. I’m going to get right into it and address three big ones in the
following:</p>

<h3>You need to build a project</h3>

<p>This is the most common one and also the least true. I’ve been to seven hackathons since I
first got to college and I didn’t even know how to declare a variable at the first two. For
the next five, I either didn’t make anything or made a dirty mash up of code which I didn’t
feel proud of. Does that mean I shouldn’t have gone to those hackathons? Not at all. In fact,
I don’t think I would even be writing this blog post if I didn’t go to those.</p>

<p>The biggest reason would be that I just would not have learned as much. You should have two
goals in mind when going to a hackathon:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To learn something new</li>
  <li>To meet people</li>
  <li>To have a good time</li>
</ul>

<p>But isn’t the whole point of a hackathon to build a project? No, let me explain.
I can almost guarantee that at your first hackathon you will not be able to make a project
or even come close. The basic programming skills that schools teach are good and are necessary
fundamentals, but they will not teach you enough to make an award-winning project. Instead,
you should focus on learning a new technology whether it be a framework or a language. You could
do this by asking people, or by making a mini project, but there is no better environment for
learning than being surrounded by people who are smarter than you.</p>

<p>For the same reason, you should be meeting people because they will (hopefully) inspire you. 
For me, seeing people who were so much smarter than me made me want to learn more. On top of that,
you get to meet new and interesting people who will make you feel more at home in the hackathon 
scene. If you attend a hackathon away from your schools, you should try to have a good time so that
you don’t regret spending your weekend away from home. You should only be trying to build a project
if you are confident in your abilities and feel like you have a strong team. In that case, you can
focus on that project instead of learning new stuff (don’t forget to sleep though).</p>

<h3>You need a team</h3>

<p>It can be a lot of fun to go to a hackathon and code with your friends. If you can’t gather enough
friends, then going to a hackathon alone isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Every single hackathon I’ve
been to has had a team-building period where you can either start a team on your own or join an existing one.
You will probably meet a good team, but even if you don’t it isn’t a big deal. You could just
leave if it is too much of a hassle for you, and spend the time working on your own thing. It might seem
like a rude thing to do, but the team can find another person. I had a bad experience forming a team of
random people once and I only wish I had left the team sooner. Remember, you should be having a good time.</p>

<h3>Hackathons are competitive</h3>

<p>Admittedly, there are a few hackathon-goers that are fighting to be the next
Zuckerburg. The vast majority of them, though, are not. You can go up
to any team at a hackathon and ask them for help and I can say with almost 100% certainty
that they will go out of their way to help you. The hackathon community is not only
really helpful towards newbies, but it’s also full of extremely intelligent and experienced people
who have faced struggles of their own. Sometimes they can be weird, sometimes they can be
narcissists, and sometimes they can be frustrated, but they will almost always be helpful.</p>

<h2>So What?</h2>

<p>I personally think that you should give hackathons at least two tries: one where you go without a full team,
and one where you go with a full time. If you didn’t enjoy either of those, then maybe hackathons aren’t for you.
For everyone else, I wholeheartedly encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and sign up for a hackathon
as soon as possible, even if you know nothing about coding. You’ll have fun and hopefully gain some coding experience
under your belt as well.</p>

        </h2>

	      <p>When I first started applying to colleges in late 2013, I had no idea what I wanted
to major in. It was a big decision, for most people their college major was what they
ended up doing for the rest of their life. I wasn’t ready to make that decision (and I’m
still not) so I spent a lot of time thinking. People always say to do what you’re good at, and
I was good at one thing – Math.</p>

<p>That narrowed down the options. I was considering some sort of science or engineering degree.
Thinking about the types of classes I was taking at the time, I narrowed the results down
even further. After considering the job market, I narrowed it all down to one option : Electrical
Engineering.</p>

<p>Electrical Engineering? But you’re a computer science major! Hold on, the story isn’t over yet.
While I was pretty set on electrical engineering I was also considering applied math or even physics.
At the time, I had only ever coded in a functional programming language called scheme in a mandatory
CS class my sophomore year of high school. I had little to no interest in it, especially considering my lack of
experience.</p>

<p>My idea of computer science at the time : <img src="http://www.gampmedia.com/wp-content/gallery/The-great-benefits-of-choosing-bespoke-software-pictures/Steps-to-finding-the-best-software-development-company.jpg" alt="Picture" height="400px" width="600px" /></p>

<p>I ended up choosing Stony brook university, a school known for its computer science program. I
was still set on electrical engineering, but what changed my mind was my acceptance into an 
honors program for computer science. I decided that I would try it out for a semester, and if
I didn’t like it then I would switch to electrical.</p>

<p>You can tell by now that I ended up liking it, but why? As I took classes I slowly began to
realize that CS wasn’t really like math in the way that many people make it out to be. Sure,
a lot of data structures and algorithms are based on mathematical principles, but what many
people in the industry do is unrelated to that. There is enough software around that developers
don’t really have to think that much about what’s going on underneath the computer’s hood.
Usually the most someone will have to do is implement their own data structure based on an existing one.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean the whole computer science field is mundane though. I just think that 
“software engineering” is a more apt name for the degree because most classes focus on the
tools and thinking necessary to build efficient software. Don’t get me wrong, I do like building
software with code, but it’s not what attracted me to the field. What I really like about CS is the
problem solving aspect. Whether it be learning a new technology or getting my algorithms to be
more efficient, I always have to think deeply.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever made something with code knows that obstacles arrive more often than they’d
like to admit. Overcoming those obstacles gives me a sense of achievement that I don’t think
you can find in any other field. It’s tiring at times to always be wrestling with the compiler
or the layout engine, but the rush of figuring it all out makes the effort worth it.</p>

        </h2>

	      <p>Whether or not you’re willing to admit it, procrastination affects all of us. Some people brag
about it, most people resent it, but everyone wants to control it. I think that you can’t really
control procrastination. It’s a natural behavior that’s innate to all people, but at the
same time why do people have it? One could argue that it’s an evolutionary behavior. It encouraged
early humans to stay in their comfort zones and away from predatory threats. It could be overcome
by natural problems such as hunger, so that humans could go out and search for food. But in the
modern day where all of our natural needs are more or less met, procrastination just hinders us
from being more productive.</p>

<p>I’m not the worst procrastinator, but it can get bad at times. A lot of the time I can get started 
on a project and work on it non-stop for several hours, but getting to that point is hard. Even as I 
write this blog post I find myself constantly switching tabs to facebook messenger to read messages 
that I’ve already seen, checking my phone for new snapchat stories, and refreshing my e-mail boxes
hoping for something new. Even though I know nothing new is coming, I still do it anyway.</p>

<p>Over my two years at college, I’ve come up with some good tools that help me battle 
procrastination. They don’t work all the time but sometimes they give me the push I need.
Here they are:</p>

<h4>Start small</h4>

<p>Whenever I look at a new daunting project or homework assignment, my first instinct is to put it
off until later. To combat this, I also break the assignment down into small parts, really small parts.
Small enough parts that they’re easy to accomplish, but also give you a sense of achievement when you’re done.
For example, the first step for me to finish up any of my AMS homework is to take out a piece of paper
and write my name on it. For a programming project, this could be as simple as setting up a repository.
Then I would follow up by creating empty files that I might need (Makefile, README, project.c), and then
write up a few function signatures. On their own, each of the tasks is simple. When you put them together,
you can get a substantial amount of work done without even realizing it.</p>

<h4>Create a list</h4>

<p>This one comes in handy on really busy days. A typical busy day might mean you have to go to your classes,
do your laundry, work out, go to a group meeting, and then go out to eat with your friends. It could
be tempting to put tasks off based on how you prioritize them (do laundry tomorrow, work out tomorrow, skip class),
but chances are it never would have ended up like this if you didn’t put them off to begin with. Every morning
when I wake up I just write down a list of the things I have to do that day on a post-it. Whenever I finish something,
I check it off. The checking off part is crucial because it gives you a big rush that you just finished a task.
That rush motivates me to get more things done and check off the entire list by the end of the day.</p>

<h4>Get off social media</h4>

<p>Social media is probably the biggest contributing factor to the modern attention span drop. When I need to
get something done, I will delete the social media apps from my phone and re-download them when I’m free again.
The reason this works is because most of the time, people will be using social media from their phone. Chances are,
you won’t be able to re-download the apps back unless you are at home. This makes it so that you can’t cave in
and re-download the apps to procrastinate. When you’re not on mobile, you could check out browser extensions that
block certain sites like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en-US">StayFocusd</a>, but the problem with those is that you could easily get rid of them if
you wanted to.</p>

<p>Some combination of these three tricks usually end up working for me. One moment I can’t focus and the next my 
projects are all completed. It feels good to check off that entire list at the end of the day and then binge watch
the entire 2nd season of Rick and Morty at home. Hopefully you’ll get your work done, and then you’ll have the
free time you’ve always wanted. Go ahead, you deserve it.</p>

        </h2>

	      <p>One of my main hobbies is spending time on some sort of flow art. Most of the time I’ll be spinning poi with
some friends but you could also find me contact juggling or hooping from time to time. It’s a way for me to 
have fun and relieve stress from school. It’s hard for me to put into words what exactly it’s all about but I 
did find a nice quote –</p>

<p><em>“Flow Arts is a general term used to describe the intersection of a variety of movement-based disciplines including dance, juggling, 
fire-spinning, and object manipulation.”</em> — The Flow Arts Institute</p>

<p>Whether you want to start a new hobby or just want to have fun, here’s my guide to getting started in the flow arts.</p>

<h3>Picking a prop</h3>

<p>There are tons of flow props – Poi, Staves, Fans, Hoops, Balls, Wands, Rope darts, Meteors, Puppy hammers, S-staves,
clubs, devil sticks, diabolos, and more! The first step is to pick a prop and stick to it. Most guys in the North American
flow scene will start with poi and girls with start with hoops but you should pick a prop based on two things: How cool you
think it looks, and how fun you think it looks. Here’s some images:</p>

<p>Poi: <img src="http://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/4603217580-fire-spinning-poi-isolation.jpg" alt="Poi" height="200px" width="200px" />.</p>

<p>Fans: <img src="http://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/4507809090-samantha-fire-fans-san-francisco.jpg" alt="Fans" height="200px" width="200px" />.</p>

<p>Hoops: <img src="http://www.loupiote.com/photos_m/8371856533-girl-fire-hoop-dancers.jpg" alt="Hoops" height="200px" width="200px" />.</p>

<p>Staff: <img src="http://www.ucd.ie/juggling/images/props/fire_staff.jpg" alt="Staff" height="200px" width="200px" />.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something “flow-ey” then I recommend poi. If you’re going for something smooth I recommend contact
juggling. If you don’t mind weight and want to be a badass, try out a staff. If you’re into circus stuff, go for devil sticks
or diabolos. If you want something simple to chill then look into wands.</p>

<h3>Obtaining a prop</h3>

<p>Unless you plan on building a prop from scratch, you’re most likely going to be buying one online. Some good sites
are <a href="https://www.homeofpoi.com/us/shop/">Home of Poi</a>, <a href="http://www.flowtoys.com/">Flowtoys</a>, 
<a href="http://www.masterongspropshop.com/">Master Ong’s prop shop</a>, and <a href="https://drexfactor.com/store">The DrexFactor store</a>.
If you’re on facebook you can also look for flow arts or circus groups in your area. There are usually local vendors
that will sell you their extra props or custom make you props.</p>

<h3>Starting out</h3>

<p>Your best friend when starting out is patience. When I first started out, my friends were doing insane tricks and I wanted
to get up to speed quick but I kept hitting myself. It was frustrating to say the least, but in a way it’s kind of like coding.
You need to failing repeatedly to learn anything, and you have to do it a lot. As long as you practice frequently you will
feel more comfortable with your prop, even if you aren’t learning a specific move or aren’t making progress, so be as patient
as you can. To learn moves, it is best to find a community of artists nearby but if that isn’t possible then look to youtube for
tutorials. Home of poi also offers tutorials for any props that you buy off of their website.</p>

<p>In a month of practice you will make significant progress and have a lot of fun as well. A big part of the enjoyment of flow for me 
is the sense of acheivement from finally learning that new move or showing my friends new tricks. If you keep it up for longer you will
also begin to see the fruits of your labor grow into other parts of life. For me it boosted my work ethic, sense of determination, and 
self-esteem dramatically. You will feel a much greater sense of freedom and maybe find a new respect for other circus and flow arts
performers. Overall, I think that learning a prop can be great for anyone and I hope that you start learning one whenever you can!</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/programming/2016/05/31/File-Compression-2.html">File Compression Part 2</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>Here I continue to talk about methods used to compress files. The two discussed here
are the Lempel-Ziv (1977) method and Huffman encoding. Both of these (or variants) are
used widely in modern file compressors such as WinRar and 7zip. The file compressor
I’m working on uses Huffman encoding in particular.</p>

<h3>Lempel-Ziv Method</h3>

<p>The Lempel-ziv method takes advantage of the fact that in a file, it is very likely
that certain strings of text will be repeated. Suppose we have this sentence:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">This</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">sentence</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">Here</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">another</span> <span class="n">sentence</span><span class="o">.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that certain strings such as “sentence” repeat in the file. We can take advantage of this by using what
is called a distance-length pair. A distance length pair takes the form &lt;d,l&gt;. The d is
the number of characters you have to go back and the l is the number of characters to copy.
To compress the file, we would start reading it and then once we reach the second “sentence.”,
we replace it with a distance-length pair as follows.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">This</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">sentence</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">Here</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">another</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s say that a character is 1 byte long and a distance-length pair is 2 bytes long.
We’ve just decreased the file length from 44 to 37. Not much, but the compression ratio increases
dramatically as file size increases (&gt;100 bytes). To decompress, we would start writing until we’ve
reached the pair, then we copy over what we wrote 25 bytes ago for 9 bytes. This restores the
file to the original state.</p>

<p>Although the idea is simple, my example is oversimplified and it turns out that
this method can get complicated fast. How do we remember strings to create pairs 
for later? How do we represent our distance-length pair? How does the decompressor
know when it has hit a distance-length pair? Nonetheless, this method is very useful
when you have it all figured out.</p>

<h3>Huffman Encoding</h3>

<p>Huffman encoding takes advantage of the fact that certain characters or strings appear
more often than others, and it allows you to represent the frequent characters with fewer
bits than the rare characters. The process of Huffman encoding involves creating a
Huffman tree which is daunting at first, but extremely useful. Suppose we have this sentence:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">She</span> <span class="n">seems</span> <span class="n">silly</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first step to compression is to build a table mapping each character with the number of
times it appears. This can be done in O(n) time.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Char</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Frequency</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Char</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Frequency</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">s</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">i</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">h</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">l</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">e</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">y</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">m</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">space</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now that we have this table, we can generate a huffman tree by doing the following (O(nlogn)):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create leaf nodes for each character-frequency pair and insert them into a priority queue (least frequency”</li>
  <li>Pop 2 elements from the queue, create a new node and set its children to the two popped elements.</li>
  <li>Set the frequency of the new node to the sum of the frequencies of its children and then insert it into the queue.</li>
  <li>If there is more than one element in the queue, go back to step 2.</li>
  <li>You are done, the last element in the queue is the root of the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>We should now have a binary tree containing each pair as a leaf node. Using this tree,
we can obtain the encodings by the path from the root to each leaf. A left represents ‘0 and
a right represents ‘1’. Here are the encodings for this example.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Char</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Encoding</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Char</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Encoding</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">s</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">11</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">i</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0011</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">h</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0000</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">l</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">e</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">01</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">y</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">m</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0010</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">space</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">101</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Finally, we can compress the sentence with this mapping to the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="mi">110000011011101010010111011100111001000001</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that in the original sentence, each character would have been represented by
one byte for a total of 15 bytes or 120 bits. The compressed file was written
in only 42 bits! If the decompressor does not know the tree, you would also have to 
encode the tree into the file. In this example it could be done in 80 bits, bumping
the file size to 122 bits. However, the tree size will stay small even if the file size increases,
meaning this method is more effective as file size increases.</p>

<p>To decompress, we simply read bit by bit and traverse the huffman tree. If we read a 
0 we go left and if we read a 1 we go right. When we hit a leaf node, we just write down
the character in that leaf node.</p>

<p>To conclude, the lempel-ziv method is most useful when certain strings repeat in the file.
The huffman method works best when certain characters appear very frequently. Both methods
work well for large files, and both are widely used in file compressors.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/programming/2016/05/27/File-Compression-1.html">File Compression Part 1</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>I have recently started working on my own file compressor titled ‘himanZip’. While working,
I’ve had to do a lot of research including reading articles, watching videos, and studying
protocols. File compression can be really interesting so I’ve decided to write some blog posts
detailing what I’ve learned.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are two types of compression:</p>

<p><strong>Lossy Compression:</strong> Takes file A and compresses it into a smaller file B. However,
decompressing B back to A will result in a loss of quality. This is because some quality is removed
in order to compress A to B.</p>

<p><strong>Lossless Compression:</strong> Takes file A and compresses it into smaller file B. Decompression
from B back to A does not result in any quality loss. The compression only removes redundant information.</p>

<p>To illustrate the quality loss of lossy compression, here is an example: Suppose you are trying
to compress an image file of someone’s face. We know that most faces are generally symmetric,
so to compress we simply save one half of the person’s face, and to decompress we copy that half over to
fully recreate the face again. However, you will lose a lot of the fine detail of the face this way because
faces are not actually symmetric.</p>

<p>I will be focusing only on lossless compression because it is inherently more valuable. One simple
form of lossless compression is run-length encoding.</p>

<h3>Run-length Encoding</h3>

<p>Run-length Encoding is a very simple form of compression that makes a lot of assumptions about the format
of a file, but is nonetheless useful for illustrating the concept of compression. Suppose we have a simple text
file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</span> <span class="n">Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww</span><span class="o">.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that there are huge stretches of the same type of characters (i,e,o,w). We can take advantage of
this and represent these another way. Instead of writing out the huge stretch, we can replace the i’s
by (# of i’s)(i). We can do this for each character stretch to compress. The compressed text file would
look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">H19i</span> <span class="n">W18e22o13w</span><span class="o">.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After compression, the total character length dropped from 76 to 16! To decompress, everytime we run into a
number we just have to copy the following character that many times. Note that this may not work if you actually
have numbers in your text file, or if there aren’t a lot of huge streches in the text, although there are ways to
get around this.</p>

<p>That’s all for now, in the next post I will talk about Lempel-Ziv(1977) encoding, and Huffman encoding.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/web/2016/05/20/New-website-and-Javascript.html">New website and Javascript</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>After another long and hard semester, I have found myself
with nothing to do. So, I decided to teach myself some more javascript
to revamp my website into one with more personality. I wanted to create a
site which served only to show off my projects, and show them off well.
This new site would need color, animations, and pictures, all three of which
my current site is lacking.</p>

<p>I decided to use javascript as the tool to make my new website look nice because
it gives you more control over HTML elements than jQuery does. Also, javascript
is an important skill to have in the world of web development, so it was
time I learned it.</p>

<p>After about 5 hours of coming up with ideas, searching through W3Schools, and 
typing up new files, I created a (somewhat) functional prototype. However, I
ended up hitting a roadblock which stopped me from turning my website vision into
a reality. Ironically, the problem I encountered could’ve been avoided if I had
just used a framework such as jQuery. Nonetheless, I did learn a lot and decided to
write a blog post about the animation and styling abilities of javascript.</p>

<h3> Styling </h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever made a website knows that all HTML elements have ‘style’ attributes
that can be modified through CSS. These style elements include all sorts of 
things from height and width to padding and borders to position coordinates. Through
javascript, you can access and modify those style elements to edit the look of an 
HTML element. Specifically, you can write a function that gets called when an event occurs
(such as a button click).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">makeRed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elementID</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elementID</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">originalColor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">color</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Original Color: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">originalColor</span><span class="p">);</span>
   <span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">color</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"red"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"New Color: Red"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is an example javascript function that can take an HTML element by its ID
and turn it to the color red. The object is obtained by the .getElementByID() method.
Then, the color field in the style can be set to red. To tie this function to the click
of a button, you would set the onClick field of the button to “makeRed(elementID);”.
Functions like these can be written to change almost all existing attributes of an element.</p>

<h3> Animation </h3>

<p>This is what makes your website fancy. An animation can’t be created by simply
changing attributes with javascript functions normally. However, you can create
animations by using an object’s transformation and transition properties. The transform
property can be changed like any other style element, except it takes in a function
instead of a value. The function specifies what change will happen to the object.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">switchUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">object</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">currIndex</span><span class="p">]);</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">height</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">clientHeight</span><span class="p">;</span>

   <span class="nx">currIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">currIndex</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nx">currSize</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">newObject</span>  <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">currIndex</span><span class="p">]);</span>
   <span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">transition</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"transform 1s linear 0s"</span>
  <span class="nx">object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">transform</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"translate(0px,"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">height</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"px)"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a snippet from my prototype where I shift an entire section
up and replace it with a new one from below. Here, the switchUp function is called
whenever the user clicks on the up arrow. If the user is on the home section, it will
shift the home up and the skills section will come from below to replace it.</p>

<p>In order to acheive this effect, I first obtain the height of the section. Then,
I set the transition property to “transform 1s linear 0s”. This means, when the object 
has to transform, the transformation will take 1 second and the animation will occur in
linear time. There will also be a 0 second delay before the transform starts. Then, I 
actually change the transform property to “translate(0px, height px)”. This translates
the section up by height pixels. Finally, I translate the skills section from below up
by that same height.</p>

<p>The transform property can also be used to scale up an object or rotate it along any axis.</p>

<h3> What I learned </h3>

<p>I learned to take HTML elements and transform them to create animations which add
flavor and aesthetic to a website. Any element can be edited, so you could have anything from
sliding colors to opening doors if you use the javascript properly.</p>

<p>Additionally, I learned that you can use any website to teach you web development. You can view
any website’s source files by simply right clicking and selecting “view page source”. By doing this,
you can learn how most websites create their animations by looking into the associated javascript
and css files. By doing this, you can rapidly learn new things to add to your websites, and also
fix existing mistakes within your own site.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I will probably be going to be at 4:30AM tonight, and that I don’t have
a real finished product, I am glad that I’ve learned some useful javascript skills.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/programming/2016/01/07/Project-2-Hungarian_Algorithm.html">The Hungarian Algorithm</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>Here I’ll talk about the other side project I worked on and	
the lesson it taught me. This is one that I thought
would be easy but turned out to be hard.</p>

<p>This is an algorithm I learned about last semester in my deterministic
models class. It is a quick way to solve an assignment problem, which is
a problem where you assign m workers to n jobs in order to minimize a cost
or maximize a profit. This is not be confused with the quadratic assignment problem,
which is NP-hard.</p>

<p>You can read more about it here: 
<a href=" http://www.math.harvard.edu/archive/20_spring_05/handouts/assignment_overheads.pdf">Harvard slides</a></p>

<p>If you’ve ever used the hungarian algorithm before, you’ll know that
it is actually pretty straightforward to do on paper. However, there are
some things that are a lot easier to do on paper than they are to do on a 
computer.</p>

<p>The two steps in particular I am talking about are the “covering” step and the 
“selection” step.</p>

<h3>The Covering Step</h3>

<p>In this step we are given an m x n matrix with some random numbers in it,
some of which are zeroes. Our goal is to cover this matrix with horizontal
or vertical lines such that we cover all zeroes with the minimum number of
lines.</p>

<p>This is easy to do on paper, but on a computer, how would we do this? 
At first I tried to find an easy way to do this, such as drawing a vertical
and horizontal line at every zero, and then removing unnecessary lines. It
turns out this ruins the next step, so I wasn’t able to do this. After spending
a lot of time on thinking how to select which lines to draw, I just decided to
draw a line in the direction with the most zeroes. Originally this didn’t work, but
I made a few tweaks and somehow it managed to pass the tests I put in place.</p>

<h3>The Selection Step</h3>

<p>In this step we are given an m x n matrix with some random numbers in it, 
some of which are zeroes. What we must do here is select certain zeroes
from the matrix such that each row and each column has exactly one selected
zero. If we have more rows than columns or vice versa, then certain rows
or columns will not have a zero.</p>

<p>At first I thought I could just go through the rows and select the 0 in
the first column that wasn’t already used. This works in some cases, but
not all. In the end, I decided I would have to brute force it (O(N^2) at worst).
I ended up looking around and found out a cool way to recursively go through a matrix.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">//Call this with empty arrays for selection and filledRows. Also use row = 0.

<p>With this, I was able to brute force select zeroes from my matrix which allowed me to 
finish up the algorithm successfully.</p>

<h3> What I learned </h3>

<p>The Hungarian algorithm is fairly useful. Although I don’t see myself using it in
the foreseeable future, I can see some ways it might be used. The lessons to learn here
are that, once again, you should always create a test suite for your projects. It was
extremely helpful for this project, as I was always jumping between steps trying to fix
new problems that kept on popping up.</p>

<p>Another lesson is that you should not be afraid to look through the internet for help about certain things. Here I did it to figure out a way to brute force through a matrix for the selection step. Yet another lesson would be that you should not be afraid to make helper methods and helper classes. In this particular problem it helped me break down the steps which were complicated on their own. But by breaking them into smaller steps, it became much more manageable.</p>

<p>Be persistent in finding solutions. I spent alot of time trying to implement methods for the steps, and then realizing there was a special case that I was forgetting about. It was frustrating that I had to keep on rewriting the methods, but every time I rewrote the method I learned more about the problem so
in the end it was worth it.</p>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/programming/2016/01/06/Project-1-Minimal-Perfect-HashMap.html">The Minimal Perfect HashMap</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>So over these past couple of weeks I’ve been working on two
side projects that I thought were interesting so that I wouldn’t
forget some of the computer science I learned over the last semester.
Both of the projects were actually much more challenging than I 
originally thought they were, and doing them both taught me
a few lessons about coding do’s and don’ts. I’ll go over one of
them here.</p>

<p>While browsing the internet I came across an article about O(1) Hash map lookups by using a method called Minimal perfect hashing. You can read about it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.demofox.org/2015/12/14/o1-data-lookups-with-minimal-perfect-hashing/"> DemoFox’s Blog</a></p>

<p>In short, this is a method that removes collisions entirely from HashMaps which allows for consistent O(1) lookups. The downside is that it requires more memory.</p>

<p>When I started working on this, I originally thought it was basically
just a chained hash map with linear probing, and the “salt” values were basically
just the location offsets from inside the map. It turns out this does not
really work or make sense, and I ran into some problems when implementing.
After I looked into it more, it turned out to be a lot more complicated than I
thought it was. Essentially, the salt values are a lot more like nonce values.
Instead of hashing a key once to find the hashmap position, you actually have to hash
a second time with the salt value to find the hashmap position if there was a collision.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="c1">// XORing the hashed key with the salt value creates a decent second hash function
</span>
<span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">saltHash</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Object</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">salt</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">salt</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="n">key</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">hashCode</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Another thing about the minimal hash map is that it is not meant to be used
in the same way as a regular hash map. In the regular hash map, you can put and
remove elements freely as well as overwrite certain elements if you put in two elements
with the same key.</p>

<p>The minimal hash map however, is meant to be used as a data structure where you
put everything in, calculate the hash function, and then access elements. Once you
calculate the hash function you are not able to add in more elements and you cannot
remove or overwrite elements either.</p>

<p>Its use is somewhat specific, you need to have
a set of data that you know will not change, and you must only want to access from that
data, and not want to change it in any way. An example of this would be if you were
managing a school database. You could create a map of student IDs to student Names, which
would then allow you to instantaneously get a student’s name just from knowing their ID, and
not having to manually search through a whole database.</p>

<h3> What I learned </h3>

<p>Overall I think that the Minimal Hashmap is a useful data structure even though the
use case is somewhat specific. The lesson I learned here is that when you try to make
something, you sure assure yourself that you really know what you are trying to make. Do this
by looking through multiple sources, and maybe even trying specific use examples and see if it
works. Also, creating test suites is very useful for these scenarios. I originally implemented
the whole thing wrong, but because I created a test suite I was able to test my program
quickly, and identify the problems properly when I was refactoring.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/blog/web/2015/12/28/first-blog-post.html">First blog post!</a>
        </h2>

	      <p>I have a blog now! I will try to post here every once
in a while about projects that I’m working on or even
off topic things that I find interesting.</p>

<p>This blog uses jekyll which is a nice static site 
generator that runs on ruby. It took me a while to get
up and running (I actually had to do it on Ubuntu in my
virtual machine because it does not support windows)
but I really like the way it came out.</p>

<p>Anyways, as of now i’m working on implementing a Minimal
perfect hashmap, and the hungarian algorithm in java. 
You can check them out on my github but
I’ve run into some roadblocks so it might take a while
before any of them are actually done.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my blog!</p>

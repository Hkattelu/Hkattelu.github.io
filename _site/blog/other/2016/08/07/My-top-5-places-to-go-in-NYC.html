  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When you’ve lived in queens for years and went to high school in manhattan you eventually
run out of things to do, even in the big apple. Sure, new stores open and new trendy hangout
spots pop up, but for the most part it’s the same thing. It’s not a bad thing, but I always
end up asking myself if it’s worth it anymore to visit Vanessa’s in chinatown or Gong Cha
in midtown. Despite this, there are a few spots in NYC that I never get tired of visiting.
They’re almost always fun or beautiful, no matter how many times I go. Here they are (in 
no particular order):</p>

<h4>Washington Square Park</h4>

<p>I come here often to visit friends at NYU or just to hang out with the NYU circus arts club.
Even in the winter this place is always bustling with people. The fountain, the arch, the statues,
and even the “pigeon man” all make this spot memorable. There’s always something going on whether it
be yoga in the grass, musicians playing on their instruments, or the chess players in the corners.
On top of being a beautiful spot overall, it’s also close by other notable spots like the Uncommons
(board game cafe).</p>

<h4>Battery park</h4>

<p>The best part about battery park is that it’s by the hudson river. I used to come here after school
to play frisbee with friends. Despite being on this list, it really is just a park. Most of the people
here are either kids who just got out of school or parent’s taking their kids out on walks. The typical
scenery consists of boats sailing across the river, people lying down to tan themselves, and guys
playing handball and basketball. I don’t make it sound like much, but my writing can’t do the 
beauty of this place justice. On top of it all, this place is riddled with statues, has a movie theater 
nearby, lots of places to eat, and there’s a free kayaking spot at Pier 26 nearby.</p>

<h4>Central Park</h4>

<p>Arguably the most famous place on this list, Central park’s beauty comes from its sheer size. I’ve
been here about ten times, but still don’t think I’ve even come close to seeing all that it has to offer.
To put it plainly, every visit to central park is a completely new experience. The only downside I can
think of is that it can take a long time to get out of here, so make sure you bring food and water.</p>

<h4>The Highline</h4>

<p>The Highline is an old and defunct train track turned into a park above the streets. In theory, you could see 
everything it has to offer in one straight walk. But the truth is that it’s such an active place that no
two visits are really the same. There are many events for all ages held here, and tons of nearby restaurants
in bustling downtown manhattan. But the true beauty of the highline doesn’t come from the place itself – but
rather its surroundings. Walking the highline gives you a novel perspective of the city and its buildings
unlike anything else. The buildings, billboards, and graffiti are what truly make this place shine.</p>

<h4>Roosevelt Island</h4>

<p>Roosevelt island, put simply, is one of the nicest places in the city. Compared to the other places on this 
list, it has almost nothing. It is simply a small island with a lot of parks. There are a few sites to see like the 
gondola to manhattan and the stone engravings at the end of island. For the most part though, it is just a
really nice place surrounded by water. In a city where vehicle noise is almost everywhere, the serene sounds of the 
water beating against the rocks makes this one of my favorite places to be.</p>

<p>Those are my top 5 spots in NYC. If I had to give any honorable mentions, they would 
go to Governor’s Island (great place to bike, but it’s only open in the summer), and 
Brooklyn Bridge (nighttime walks on the bridge are arguably the most beautiful thing
in the city, and that’s not even mentioning the DUMBO area). The next time you want
to hang out with some friends and need a place to go, look no further. If you’re just 
a visitor in the city, make sure to check all of these places out. You won’t be 
disappointed.</p>

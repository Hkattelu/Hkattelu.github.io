I have a blog now! I will try to post here every once
in a while about projects that I'm working on or even
off topic things that I find interesting. 

This blog uses jekyll which is a nice static site 
generator that runs on ruby. It took me a while to get
up and running (I actually had to do it on Ubuntu in my
virtual machine because it does not support windows)
but I really like the way it came out.

Anyways, as of now i'm working on implementing a Minimal
perfect hashmap, a hungarian algorithm, and an HTML 
parser in java. You can check them out on my github but
I've run into some roadblocks so it might take a while
before any of them are actually done.

Thanks for checking out my blog!

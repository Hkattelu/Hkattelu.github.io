I first started officially working out a little over 2 years ago in my last year of high school.
At the time, I was far from consistent. I worked out when it was convenient for me and would only
go if one of my friends was going. The big guys at the recreation centers intimidated me at the time
so I was too scared to go in alone. I also took a weight training class at school which was about 35
minutes of exercise 2-3 times a week which is start.

As a reference point, I could bench press 45lbs when I first started. Over the course of the next two 
years, I was on and off at the gym at college. There stretches of months where I punctually worked out and
the results slowly but surely followed. However, there were also periods where my schoolwork caught up
with me and I lost much of the strength I spent my time building. I also didn't really eat as much as
I should have been eating.

At the start of this summer, I could bench press about 85lbs and had decent form on the exercises that I did.
Now, about two and a half months later I feel like I've made it farther than I ever have since I first started.
I've made a lot of improvements since I started working out:

* I go to the gym alone
* I eat a lot more 
* I go to the gym at least 3 times a week
* I don't skip any muscle groups
* I see visible results

You might be asking - If you've been working out for 2 years why write a 2 month report? 2 months seem trivial
when compared to 2 years. The answer is that I've been doing it *right* these past months. Looking back, I 
was always exercising with at least one fatal flaw whether it be not eating enough or having poor form. 
These past 2 months exercising has become more of a fun routine than a tri-weekly chore. That's why I'm starting
the counter from the start of this summer. That's not to say the rest of my time was a waste because I learned 
a lot in that time and achieved some results.

Anyways, here's some information (in lbs) about the kind of exercises I do now vs. 2 months ago. As for diet, I just
started eating more whenever possible and took protein supplements.

| Info | Previous weight | Current weight | Reps |
| :--: | :-------: | :--: | :-------: |
| Body weight | 115 | 120 | N/A |
| Bench Press | 85 | 105 | 5x5 |
| Incline Press | 50 | 70 | 4x6 |
| Squat | 95 | 135 | 5x8 |
| Seated Rows | 70 | 85 | 5x8 |
| Leg Press | 180 | 230 | 3x8 |
| Dumbell Overhead Press | 60 | 90 | 5x6 |
| Calf Raises | 45 | 70 | 2x60 |

There are a lot of muscle groups missing from the above table because my routine changed drastically
and there are certain exercises that I stopped doing as well as new ones that I introduced. As a result,
there is no clear reference point from 2 months ago so it isn't worth adding to the table. Essentially,
I do less free weights for my arms and back and instead do body weight exercises like pull-ups and dips.

That's all for this report, but I will definitely be doing these types of posts every once in a while.

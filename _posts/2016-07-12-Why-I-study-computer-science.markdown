When I first started applying to colleges in late 2013, I had no idea what I wanted
to major in. It was a big decision, for most people their college major was what they
ended up doing for the rest of their life. I wasn't ready to make that decision (and I'm
still not) so I spent a lot of time thinking. People always say to do what you're good at, and
I was good at one thing -- Math.
